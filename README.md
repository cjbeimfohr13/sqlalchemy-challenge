# SQLAlchemy Homework - Surfs Up!
For this homework assignment we performed a basic climate analysis and explored the data(hawaii slite files (Resources.hawaii.sqlite)). This included summary statistcs of the precipation levels over a 12 month period with a dataframe displaying the precipation of each day throughout the entire year with a matplotlib graph. Not only were the precipiation levels examined but so were the stations that tracked the precipation levels. The station analysis determined the most popular stations that acquired the most observations and then plotted the results in 12 bins within a histogram. The final result of this assignment was a climate app that examined all of the queries performed throughout the assignment.
